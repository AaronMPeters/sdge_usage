# SDGE Energy Usage Analysis

This notebook will generate some graphs of your energy usage by loading the data that can be downloaded from the SDGE website using the "Green Button Download" under the Usage tab of your account.

You can use Google Colab to run this without needing to setup anything on your computer. Go to https://colab.research.google.com/ and click on the "GitHub" tab, then paste the URL to this repository (https://github.com/kernco/sdge_usage) and press Enter or click the magnifying glass icon. You should see "sdge_usage_analysis.ipynb" appear. Click on it and it will open the notebook in Google Colab. Follow the instructions in the notebook to upload the data file and generate the graphs.
